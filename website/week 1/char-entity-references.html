            The Quaid-E-Azam once said: &lt;Think about this&gt;
        </h1>
        <p>
            "Think a thousand times before you make a decision, but once you make it, stand by it as one man."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Failure is a word uknown to me."
        </p>
        <p>
            "There are two great powers in this world; the power of the sword and the power of the pen. However, there is a power stronger than them both, the power of women."
        </p>
        <p>
            "With faith, discipline and selfless devotion to duty, there is nothing worthwhile that you cannot achieve."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Prepare for the worst, expect the best."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Few individuals significantly alter the course of history. Fewer still modify the map of the world. Hardly anyone can be credited with creating a nation-state. Mohammad Ali Jinnah did all three."
        </p>
        <p>
            "You will have to make up for the smallness of your size by your courage and selfless devotion to duty, for it is not life that matters, but the courage, fortitude and determination you bring to it."
        </p>
        <p>
            -Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the founder of my my homeland.
